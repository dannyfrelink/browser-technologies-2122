## 💡 Concept

My project started off with creating a wireflow for my website. I started to think about the core functionalities I wanted to implement into my project. When these were decided, I could start with sketching some ideas. You can find my wireflows in my wiki.

With the ideas in mind, I started coding. We got the assignment to implement as much progressive enhancement as we could. Therefore, I also decided to begin with the core functionalities of my website. This was just pure HTML. After the core functionalities, I then added my styling to make the website more usable. After that, I added my Javacript to the website to make it more pleasurable to use. At last, I tested my website on different browsers and added feature detection as well.

## 📝 Wishlist

There is not much more I wished I could've done. Of course, it would've been nice to experiment with API's and other stuff. To be realistic, I don't think I had the spare time to do so. With the time I had, I am quite content with the project as a whole.
